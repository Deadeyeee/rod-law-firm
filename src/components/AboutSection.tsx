                Grown and raised in Chatham-Kent, I established Rodriguez Law Office in 2020 to
                service the communities' family, real estate, and construction law needs. Since then
                my practice has expanded to help homeowners and builders throughout Ontario.

                As a young and independent lawyer, I can provide a greater level of personal
                attention at more competitive rates than older lawyers. Let me show you the
                difference that makes.
